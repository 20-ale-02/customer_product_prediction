## Project Overview

A financial institution is seeking to increase its product sales using **cross-selling** strategies. Using customer behavioral data, this project explores the ability to predict future purchases through machine learning models.

## Methodology

1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Understanding the distribution, correlations, and missing values.
2. **Preprocessing**: Preparing features for ML, including normalization and encoding.
3. **Modeling**:
   - Decision Tree
   - Neural Network with TensorFlow
4. **Evaluation**: Model accuracy and insights from predictions.

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas & NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn
- TensorFlow
